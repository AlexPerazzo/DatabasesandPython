# Overview

The purpose of this program is to give me practice integrating mySQL/databases in general with code (python in particular in this case). I think Databases are a super important tool, and I want to get more comfortable using them.

In this case, it's a straight forward to-do list style of code, but everything is saved/drawn from a database using mySQL. Feel free to take a look at this video where I explain the code more in depth.

# The Database

I am using mySQL, with a server running through MySQL workbench 8.0. I create a new database (if it doesn't exist already) with a table that has a auto_incrementing key and a column of characters.

# Development Environment

Visual Studio Code is the IDE I used. The code is in python and I had to import mysql.connector.

# Future Work

- Allow the user to create their own columns (more details they want stored about the movie)
- Be able to sort through movies based off the ratings and/or other columns
- Incorporate other types of media
